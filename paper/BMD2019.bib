  abstract = {We present a method to find an optimal handling bicycle using purely analytical and numerical means. Given a linear parametrized bicycle vehicle model, a simple manual controller, and a model-based metric that correlates with subjective handling measures, we formulate the search for optimal geometric parameters that give the best handling bicycle. Optimal bicycle designs for a number of design speeds are discovered including bicycles with unintuitive geometry, such as large negative trail. The resulting maximum handling quality metrics for the optimal bicycle designs follow a logarithmic relationship with respect to design speed. These optimal handling bicycles can be ridden at speeds other than the design speed and, in general, handling difficulty decreases with increasing speed. Finally, we show that there is little evidence of correlation between bicycle open-loop stability and optimal handling.},

  title = {On the Implementation of an Interior-Point Filter Line-Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming},
  volume = {106},
  issn = {0025-5610, 1436-4646},
  abstract = {.We present a primal-dual interior-point algorithm with a filter line-search method for nonlinear programming. Local and global convergence properties of this method were analyzed in previous work. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, including the feasibility restoration phase for the filter method, second-order corrections, and inertia correction of the KKT matrix. Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear programming.},
